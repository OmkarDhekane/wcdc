# 🌾 Wheat Crop Disease Classification (Multi-Label Classification)

This project presents a deep learning-based approach to detect multiple wheat leaf diseases from images. It uses a *multi-label* classification pipeline that identifies one or more diseases or a healthy label in a single image. Additionally, it provides insights model explainability with grad-CAM.
