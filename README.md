# 🌾 Wheat Crop Disease Classification (Multi-Label Classification)

This project presents a deep learning-based approach to detect multiple wheat leaf diseases from images. It uses a multi-label classification pipeline that identifies one or more diseases — or a healthy label — in a single image.

## 📌 Overview

- **Type**: Multi-label Image Classification  
- **Model**: EfficientNetB1 (Transfer Learning)  
- **Dataset Size**: 2,414 images  
- **Classes**: 6 Diseases + 1 Healthy  
- **Goal**: Robust and accurate detection of crop diseases to assist early intervention
